                  Shraddha Arya, who plays Preeta in Zee TV&apos;s show &apos;Kundali
                  Bhagya&apos;, was recently robbed by her interior designer while
                  she was away. The actress shared her ordeal on her Instagram
                  account and revealed that the interior designer named
                  Siddharth Punjabi robbed her home material and ran away with
                  the fittings and other items. However, it seems like the
                  interior designer has realized his mistake as he has returned
                  her stolen things with an apology. Arya informed the same in
                  her latest post and thanked her fans and followers for their
                  support.
